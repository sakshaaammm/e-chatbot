# e-chatbot

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/sakshaaammm/e-chatbot)
I've built a modern, responsive e-commerce chatbot interface with enhanced design and functionality:

### **Features:**
- **UI Design**:  
  - Clean, intuitive chat interface with a responsive design.  
  - Modern **pink theme** with elegant typography (Playfair Display for headings, Poppins for body).  
  - Visual hierarchy, smooth animations, and hover transitions.

- **Core Functionality**:  
  - Real-time message processing with natural language understanding.  
  - Product searches, price inquiries, and category-specific queries.  
  - Visual product cards with images, descriptions, and price ranges.

- **Technical Highlights**:  
  - Built using **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS** for clean, maintainable code.  
  - Component-based architecture with services for product data handling.  
  - Better organization: reusable components, utility functions, and mock product database.

### **Enhanced User Experience**:
- Elegant pink gradient background, subtle shadows, and rounded corners.  
- Improved input styling, message bubbles, and product cards.  
- Session persistence for a seamless chat flow.

### **Sample Queries**:  
- "Show me electronics"  
- "What's the price range for opticals?"  
- "Find sunglasses"  

The chatbot provides engaging responses with visually appealing product cards and formatted details.
